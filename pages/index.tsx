          Hello, I am Seol SO, known as Cattynip from South Korea, and a
          ninth-grade student at Albert College. I have been dreaming of being a
          computer programmer, creating value for society by developing things
          for customers. Why? Because I love Writing Codes and Building
          Services. I always keep the phrase `Learn Anytime, Write Anywhere`. in
          my mind to embark on the right path. To follow the phrase, I always
          make a commit every single day.
        </p>

          And, as you might know, this website is not fully built. I plan to
          build this website in 2027, when I graduate from highschool, Albert
          College. This website will be a website that introduces about ME, my
          vision and dream, and projects that I have launched so far, but with
          fancy animations and interactions. You can simply click the links
          below to know more about me.
